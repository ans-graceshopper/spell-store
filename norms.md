Daily process

Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
End of day standup started by today’s Taskmaster.
Pair program on assigned tasks
Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

Team expectations

Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
Work when you need to but don’t expect pull requests to be resolved immediately.
Keep the team updated in slack when you’re working late and what you’re working on.
Keep the project board updated with in progress tasks so we know what you’re working and can get in touch if needed.
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Use Github’s pull request system and add as many comments as you can. Add both people to pull request reviews.
Slack team members before pulling, merging, and pushing.
For big features, merge together and review code. Otherwise, use comments on pull requests.
After everyone has looked at the issue and tried different solutions.
Take time to use internet resources first.
Ask teammates first if you’re struggling individually.
If we can’t get on the right track and it’s been 30 minutes, we ask for help.
We should pair as often as possible. With a group of three, pairing all the time still gives one person solo time.
For the non-pairing partner, it depends on the issues left and what the pair is working on. Solo could also be good time to review merges.

Issues

Talk about the problem with all teammates.
If it can’t be resolved, put it to a vote as a last resort.
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
In terms of pulling your weight, have a discussion during Stand Ups about your plan for the day and reflecting on the previous day. Hold yourself accountable for what you are and were able to accomplish.
Address frustrations ASAP and involve everyone in the discussion. Slow down with things and get on the same page.
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
